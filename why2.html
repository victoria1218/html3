<p>If you take a look at the source code for this html document, you will notice that there is a section that is not displayed.  The style container allows you to create predefined styles that go together with some kind of selector.  The selector is the word outside of the curly braces {} and the style definition that is assigned to it is inside the curly braces.</p>

<p>The selector may be an entire html tag, in which case every matching html tag gets that style.  Notice that line 8 of this document defines a style for the p tag, so all of the p tags inherit that style.  However, line 12 adds .special to the end of the selector name.  The "." refers to a special html tag attribute called a <span style="color:red">class</span>.  A class can be used to create a definition for a number of unrelated html tags, or when you want to specify only a few.  Notice that only the p tag defined on line 50 gets the red border, because it is the only p tag that contains a class="special" attribute.</p>

<p>A class does not need to be preceeded by a tag name.  You can leave the tag name out if you want, and then ANY tag that has that class definition inherits the style.  Look at line 2 of this document.  Any tag with the class="fish" definition will receive this style.</p>

<p>Note that you can also multiply multiple defined styles to an html tag.  Notice that the div tag on line 37 includes 2 different classes, separated by a space.  You can have as many classes assigned, as long as they are separated by spaces and in quotation marks.</p>
</div>

<div class="story">
    <p style="background-color:rgb(45, 234, 234); color: white;">Once upon a time there was a <span class='fish'>fish</span> that lived in a bowl. The bowl was small and dirty. It had a signe that said “No <b class='fish'>fishing</b>”. The <span class='fish'>fish</span> felt safe with that signe.</p>

<p class="special">The <span class='fish'>fishes</span> familie also had a cat. The cat was always trying to get the <span class='fish'>fish</span>. He waited quietly to see if the familie was watching. He was a super smart cat and he watched then creept up to the bowl. Next, he slowly put his paw in and tried to catch the <span class='fish'>fish</span>. The <span class='fish'>fish</span> looked at the sign. The cat could not read.</p>

<p>Since the cat was hungry he ate the <span class='fish'>fish</span>. The cat smiled at the familie but the familie did not smile at the cat. They were very mad. So they sent the cat out!</p>

<p class="lesson">Finally, note the real advantage of using an internal style.  You can quickly change any of the definitions in your style container and change the entire document!</p>

<p class="lesson">Note we also have several examples of the use of the p vs div tags.  The p tag is generally used to identify a paragraph, and the div tag is used to idenfity a block, which could include multiple paragraphs.  Functionally, they are almost the same and they are just used differently.  You will also notice on line 23 that we can actually do a lot more with styles.  There is a great deal of information that is available and your imagination is generally the only limiting factor.</p>
