<p>The following document is an example of the limitations of using inline styles (styles that are defined right inside the html tags.)  Suppose you wanted to change all of the green fish words to a different color; you would have a lot of typing to do!  Notice, however, that all of the words that have fish are using a span tag to define the style, and all of them are defined exactly the same way.
</p>

<p>When you have a lot of style definitions that are going to be exactly the same, this is the perfect time to make use of internal style sheets, or sheets that apply globally to your entire document.  Open up the document why2.html to see the same document defined a different way.</p>

<p style="background-color:rgb(45, 234, 234); color: white;">Once upon a time there was a <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fish</span></span> that lived in a bowl. The bowl was small and dirty. It had a signe that said “No <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fishing</span>”. The <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fish</span> felt safe with that signe.</p>

<p>The <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fishes</span> familie also had a cat. The cat was always trying to get the <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fish</span>. He waited quietly to see if the familie was watching. He was a super smart cat and he watched then creept up to the bowl. Next, he slowly put his paw in and tried to catch the <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fish</span>. The <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fish</span> looked at the sign. The cat could not read.</p>

<p>Since the cat was hungry he ate the <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">fish</span>. The cat smiled at the familie but the familie did not smile at the cat. They were very mad. So they sent the cat out!</p>
