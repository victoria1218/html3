# Defining Styles

## Objectives
* create an embedded style
* create class or html tag selectors that can be used to apply a style across a document
* use the position, top, left, width, and height styles to create an html block and place it on the html document

We have looked at Inline Styles, where the style is defined inside an HTML Tag.  A better approach to use an *embedded* style, where the style is included in a style tag.

Open the page1.html document and see how this can be used.

* A tag can include multiple styles. They are separated by a space
* Multiple styles can be defined in the style tag, they are separated by a comma
* A class is defined with a dot (.) followed by the name of the class
* A class definition can be assigned to a specific tag, but can be a global class

## Assignment

Style the document called document1.html using embedded Styles.  Use layouts to make the page look better. Work in full screen mode so we don't have to worry about cropping the page. You will need to add all the proper elements to make this a proper html document.

### Requirements:
Your style document must include the following:
* a background image for the entire body
* a global style for every p tag
* a class that applies only to p tags
* a div tag with a background color and foreground in a complementing color (no black on black)
* a class that contains a defintition for a border
* a div tag that contains padding around the content (you may want to google padding if you're not sure what it means)
* a class that defines the font properties
    * font size (can use pixels or em.  What is the difference between the two?)
    * font style
    * font family
